# Projects

## Blog

A blog that obtains its data from an API served from the backend. 

The UI is inspired by reddit. The data is held inside cards, which expand into a scrollable overlay 
with a link to the full blog page.

## Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple tic-tac-toe game built on the React tutorial.

It has been expanded upon by adding an AI and multiplayer option. 

## Chat

A simple real time chat.

It is built on an existing project that combined React and Django. The chat UI is inspired by Facebook messenger.

No messages are stored and all messages are sent through WSS and HTTPS. There is only 1 room though (global).
